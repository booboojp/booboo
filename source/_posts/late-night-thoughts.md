title: Late Night Thoughts
---
Hey Floofs and Cuties, I am sorry for writing this but it is late in the night and I had some thoughts.
First thing is I found an artist I like, his name is NF.
Anyways the grind never stops so here goes, but before I get writing I do need to let you know that my mind is just occupied with a past partner, I am sure you all know what that feels like.

Anyways to my thoughts, I was thinking of a format for my blogging, because I am using Markdown but it is very messy and overall I think I am improve on my skills.
Maybe splitting it up into different sections will work.
I was thinking that maybe I could have it in 5 different sections, the first one is my greetings  and how my days going, the next one will be about my thoughts, just stuff I thought of for the day, but I want to break this into two sections, the first one is just thoughts that don’t really have much to do with coding and the second is coding and development related shit.
I thought this would help me stay organized with my blogging because my thoughts are always so messy that I struggle writing this. I mean I am listening to Roar by Katy Perry and hike rocking back and forth and fidgeting in a messy environment, see my point?
Ok, the next section is progress on my current coding project, what I did for that day and what are my plans for the future. But I won’t be making it for general audiences to understand like I have been so far, ha, no one will read this shit anyways. But regard less, I feel like it will help keep me accountable! I 

The next part for some drama is stuff that I learned that day, I know this will be small but every day it will really help me learn. You know what why not add the stats I did that day, the first part is the stuff I learned; and then the stats of the day like the commits, amount of time spent and more!

And of corse the fith and final one is a goodbye message, that should be pretty shelf explanatory.


Now, as you have probably read it’s like I am talking to the blog, to your guys but not actually formatted text. The most I am doing right now is basic spell check and grammar checks.

I want to make sure to edit my blog post of the day, and only post one a day at the end of the day, I will be adding to it like this, the talking way thorough out the day, but at night I will edit it and make the blog post!


Wow… it does get lonely if I make it like I am just talking to a screen, I mean at least streaming you know people are on the other side. Yeah I see that as another downside to chatting like this but I still want to add my own comments to it.
So I was thinking I can add little inputs and text boxes thought out the post of my direct text of what I am saying, just to add my own personal touch!

Yeah… that seems good it’s just that right now I am reflecting on parts of my life that I have left behind or have been pushed away from.
A part of me wants to come back but I am not sure what to do. It’s like an abusive relationship, I am to sacred to leave, to scared to truly forget, it is apart of me and I just can’t let it go. It happened to early in my life I can’t let it go. I will talk about it more in the future when I release my blog posts, maybe some personal posts or just me venting.
Because I have never really shared myself online at all. So it will be a relief when I can do this almost hidden.

I just can let it leave my mind, it has stoped me from doing my work and delayed my coding project another day due to my head being too clouded.
Right now I am blasting to music while relaxing in bed while writing to try and hide my pain.
But I can bottle it in a little more, I believe in myself. I have done it for so long I can continue.

You know what, I have decided that I would like to go back to the place that kicked me out, the community that was my second life.

Oh… shit… haha, I got off topic so I will stick to the topic, well what’s the topic I am just saying what I want at this point and no one will read it.
