title: First Post!

Hey everyone, I am finally gaining the confidence to write my blog, even though no one will see this. First, let me get started with an introduction about myself.

Hello, my name is Booboo. I am just trying to learn more about development, and trying to find something to specialize in. Right now I am working on a project code named Judgement Chan.

This is a passion project that I am starting because I want to build something that can leave a minor impact.

I think a great idea would be to write about it and tell you all about it.
Judgment Chan is a discord bot that will be based on funny content and AI. I am trying to make it so you can do what you want online, like look at funny content, and use AI. 
But here is the thing with the AI part, I am a firm believer that AI should be able to be used by anyone in any way they want. No restrictions on LLMs like ChatGPT, just use it the way you want.
The next part about AI is AI art, I believe that it is its own thing and does not copy anything. That is why I want Judgement Chan to have so many models and guides along with the removed watermark for Stabel Diffusion and other models like that.

Ok, back to me. I am still getting better at javascript and Python, I mean I know basic HTML and CSS but who does not? I can build JavaScript projects with just documentation and no video guides and such, but I would still consider myself a beginner.
I will tell more about myself later, but for now, let's get into what I have done today.

My work for today started when I read a blog post on dev.to to start my blog so I did. Then the next thing I did was go onto Github and look up "blog". Then I found this framework, **Hexo**, and then I did a few basic setup commands and now I have a blog. It is quite convent because I just make a new markdown file and then I have a new post!
I am thinking of putting a nice theme on this website later, moving to another project, or creating my blog. But for now, all I need is just to record shit so that is what I am doing.

Now I am using a fancy online Markdown Editor right now.



Now I guess this is where I will write my current progress on the project so far:
Right now I am working on getting a full player profile system working with MongoDB and making the MSG embeds. And I want to get a profile system up, and I mean tracking the most used tags, an XP, level, leaderboard, and prestige system later. And some stuff for pools, but I will do that later, I just need to get a beta out. 

The reason I am rushing to get the Beta out is one of two reasons, the first one is I have ADHD meaning I can't stick to a project for long unless I have progress. The second reason is that I just need confidence, and maybe one or two users, but the real goal is to find a team. I know it will take some time but right now I have my friend who does not know shit about coding and is just there for ideas, and another friend who I am closer with who can just design some stuff and is willing to help, but they are in the starting stages of learning so it will take a while.

But, my concern for getting a team is other people, there are only so many people who will say "Yes Booboo, of course, I will spend hours of my free time developing a special discord bot system with Ai that is unrestricted and I am not afraid of this!"

Yeah.. that will be hard to get so that's why I am trying to look at two demographics. Furries and Femboys.
They make up a lot of the IT market and are some of the most degenerate and kinky people I know, and that's what I love. But enough about that for now.


Well, I guess that's about it for my first blog entry, I guess this is another New Year resolution that I am starting but who cares? This is for me and me alone, maybe it will turn into something else maybe not.

Goodbye my little but floofs!
